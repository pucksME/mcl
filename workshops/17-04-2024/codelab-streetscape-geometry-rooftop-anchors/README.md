# ARCore Streetscape Geometry and Rooftop anchors Codelab project

This repository contains the template used for the [Get started with the Streetscape Geometry and Rooftop anchors APIs Codelab](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/arcore-streetscape-geometry-rooftop-anchors#0).

This repository contains the following branches:

* `main`, the starting point of the codelab;
* `step-3`, corresponding to the code that you should have at the end of [step 3: Visualize streetscape-geometry data](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/arcore-streetscape-geometry-rooftop-anchors#2);
* `step-4`, corresponding to the code that you should have at the end of [step 4: Perform a hit-test with streetscape-geometry data](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/arcore-streetscape-geometry-rooftop-anchors#3).
* `step-5`, corresponding to the code that you should have at the end of [step 5: Use rooftop-anchor data](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/arcore-streetscape-geometry-rooftop-anchors#4).

If you get stuck at any point in the codelab, use `git checkout` to check out the correct code so you can move on.
