abstract = {The popularity of biometrics-based user identification has significantly increased over the last few years. User identification based on the face, fingerprints, and iris, usually achieves very high accuracy only in controlled setups and can be vulnerable to presentation attacks, spoofing, and forgeries. To overcome these issues, this work proposes a novel strategy based on a relatively less explored biometric trait, i.e., gait, collected by a smartphone accelerometer, which can be more robust to the attacks mentioned above. According to the wearable sensor-based gait recognition state-of-the-art, two main classes of approaches exist: 1) those based on machine and deep learning; 2) those exploiting hand-crafted features. While the former approaches can reach a higher accuracy, they suffer from problems like, e.g., performing poorly outside the training data, i.e., lack of generalizability. This paper proposes an algorithm based on hand-crafted features for gait recognition that can outperform the existing machine and deep learning approaches. It leverages a modified Majority Voting scheme applied to Fast Window Dynamic Time Warping, a modified version of the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm with relaxed constraints and majority voting, to recognize gait patterns. We tested our approach named MV-FWDTW on the ZJU-gaitacc, one of the most extensive datasets for the number of subjects, but especially for the number of walks per subject and walk lengths. Results set a new state-of-the-art gait recognition rate of 98.82% in a cross-session experimental setup. We also confirm the quality of the proposed method using a subset of the OU-ISIR dataset, another large state-of-the-art benchmark with more subjects but much shorter walk signals.}
